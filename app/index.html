In part three of this series we will create our actual build using the following Node.js modules: gulp-plumber, gulp-uglify, browser-sync, gulp compass, gulp-autoprefixer, del, gulp-rename. We will also set up tasks for css, compass-sass, javascript, html, browser-sync and show how to run gulp tasks in sequence for our final build.

Wow im enjoying auto build
